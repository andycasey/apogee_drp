mask_v01 is from Henrik analysis, with 8575 pixels
mask_v01_aspcap is from Henrik analysis, with 7514 pixels
mask_v02_aspcap is from Henrik analysis + Br11, with 7514 pixels
global is just edges to mask to original 7214 pixels
global_mask_01 is v01 combined with global
global_mask_02 is v02 combined with global, with Br11 masked

param_v01.mask made from edge, global, plus remove elements except C, N, O, Mg, Fe, Ni
param_v02.mask made from edge, global, plus remove elements except C, N, Mg, Fe, Ni
param_v03.mask made from C, N, Mg, Fe, minus contributions from edge, global and other elements
param_v04.mask made from C, N, O, Fe, minus contributions from edge, global and other elements

Elements:
 .filt files are original window from Ricardo Carrera analysis
 mask.mkwind extracts the window wavelength ranges into .wind files
 These are edited by hand to turn off windows, e.g. from individual line analysis (henrik)
 mask.mkmask then turns these back into .mask files, with option of masking additional
   pixels from global mask above
