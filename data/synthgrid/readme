New RV grids made using Turbospect 20180901 synthesis + synphot grids for hot stars
See $APOGEE_SPECLIB/synth/rvgrid and $APOGEE_DIR/python/apogee/apred/rvgrid.py

all spectra in single file apg_synthgrid.fits with
HDU1 : table with parameters
HDU2 : LSF smoothed spectra at apStar sampling
HDU3 : LSF smoothed spectra at higher sampling (4.75e-6) for apVisit spedcdtra

1) Reading mini grid for coarse characterization

IDL>read_synth,'f_apg5coarse.dat',g=g

you will end up with the grid in the array g
IDL>help,g
G               FLOAT     = Array[2, 4, 4, 11257]
where the first three dimensions are for metallicity 
([Fe/H]=-2 and 0), Teff (3500,4000,4500,5000 K), and
logg (0.0,1.5,3.0, 4.5 dex).


2) Rad. Velocity by cross-correlation 

IDL>xlib,'f_apg5coarse.dat','*fits',30000.,'output.txt'

Expects to read FITS files with dim. 3xnpix, where npix
is the number of wavelengths and the three layers
in the first dimension give wavelengths, fluxes and errors.
This part will obviously need to be adjusted.
