APOGEE wavelength calibration

Does the wavelength calibration drift?

- look at weekly solutions, compare pixel locations for set range of wavelengths
  also chip locations
   wave.compare()
  see what seems like some variation both in pixel locations and chip locations,
  however, to what extent is this just noise in the solutions?

  when you look at chip locations _within_ a weekly solution, they agree much
  better, so this suggests that it is just noise!

- create annual solutions from cal groups every 10 days or so
  if the rms for each group is good and constant over the year, suggests little
  variation in wavelength solution

- still, dither shifts between pairs show row dependent offsets, and possibly
  different for different chips

  is this seen in the annual wavelength solution? Does this sample different
  dither positions?
