Quality Assurance
*****************

At the end of the APOGEE data reduction, a number of quality assurance (QA) plots and webpages are produced.  These
can be used to ascertain the quality of the data and the reduction.

Note, you need the sdss username and password to access the online QA pages.

MJD and Fields Lists
--------

One good starting points is the
`MJD view <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/qa/mjd.html>`_
page. Each row of the table pertains to a particular night of observing, providing links to the
on-site observers' logs, a list of the APOGEE exposures, the raw data directory, a nightly
Q/A page giving information about the observations and data reduction, a Q/A page for each 
observation, and links to allVisit and allStar summary files specific to the night in question. 
Links to instrument monitoring plots and full-survey allVisit and allStar files are provided 
at the top of the page. 

Another good starting point is the `Fields view <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/qa/fields.html>`_ page.
Each row of table pertains to an observation (normally multiple exosures, combined) of a 
particular field center. The columns of the table provide information about the field, the
observation of it, and the achieved S/N. Plots of all of the field centers observed to date
are provided at the top of the page (Note: these plots is probably not being updated properly!) 
along with links to instrument monitoring plots and full-survey allVisit and allStar files.

Visit level
-----------

Each visit has an apQA and apVisit QA pages that give useful summary pages and spectra.  Here are examples,
`apQA-1279-59584.html <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/visit/apo25m/20882/1279/59584/html/apQA-1279-59584.html>`_ and 
`apPlate-1279-59584.html <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/visit/apo25m/20882/1279/59584/html/apPlate-1279-59584.html>`_.

Star level
----------

There is a star-level QA page that lists useful summary information and plots.  Here's an example page:
`2M06482624+0357058.html <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/stars/apo25m/91/91537/html/2M06482624+0357058.html>`_.
