Quality Assurance
*****************

At the end of the APOGEE data reduction, a number of quality assurance (QA) plots and webpages are produced.  These
can be used to ascertain the quality of the data and the reduction.

Note, you need the sdss username and password to access the online QA pages.

MJD List
--------

A good starting point is the
`MJD view <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/qa/mjd.html>`_
page that lists all of the nights and observations.  There are columns for the raw exposure lists, the observers
log, and visit level pages.  There are also links to the allVisit and allStar summary files.

Visit level
-----------

Each visit has an apQA and apVisit QA pages that give useful summary pages and spectra.  Here are examples,
`apQA-1279-59584.html <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/visit/apo25m/20882/1279/59584/html/apQA-1279-59584.html>`_ and 
`apPlate-1279-59584.html <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/visit/apo25m/20882/1279/59584/html/apPlate-1279-59584.html>`_.

Star level
----------

There is a star-level QA page that lists useful summary information and plots.  Here's an example page:
`2M06482624+0357058.html <https://data.sdss5.org/sas/sdsswork/mwm/apogee/spectro/redux/daily/stars/apo25m/91/91537/html/2M06482624+0357058.html>`_.
