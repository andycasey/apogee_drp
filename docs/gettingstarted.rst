The |apogee_drp| pipeline is a combination of IDL and python programs and some shell scripts.

The |apogee_drp| pipeline is separated into five parts:
 - ap3D
 - ap2D
 - ap1D visit
 - RV
 - QA

The first three steps are called ``apred`` and are run on a list of files using a ``plan`` file that specifies the exposures numbers and calibration data to be used.

There is daily processing and full reductions of many years of data.
